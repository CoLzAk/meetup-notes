# Cloud Native Computing Foundation Bordeaux #2

## CNCF News

- gRPC has been marked GA since the 23rd of October 2018. You can read the announcement on their official website [here](https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-web-ga).
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) 2.5 has been released with notably the support for OpenMetrics and unit testing for rules.
- [Ceph](https://ceph.com/) has not its own organization and is not part of the Linux foundation anymore. The Ceph foundation will continue to contribute on object storage more independently.
- [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) has become the third CNCF Graduated project!
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) 1.13 has been released, with [CoreDNS](https://coredns.io/) as the default DNS server, the Container Storage Interface, a more serious Kubeadm and the StatefulSets.

## From GitLabCI to Kubernetes
By Gaëtan Ars, Expert Lead Engineer @ Orange Business Services

With Kubernetes, resources can be shared across the same namespace and rights management exists at every level. To handle connections, the ingress controller is here for load balancing, SSL edge termination and virtual zones.
A Kubernetes cluster operator will most likely use Kubeadm to administer their cluster.

What can you do by associating GitLab and Kubernetes?
- Execute runners;
- Deploy applications;
- Review applications;
- Access container logs;
- Monitoring;
- Access container terminals;
- Automate the DevOps.

How would you connect a Kubernetes cluster to GitLab?
1. Create a ServiceAccount for GitLab;
2. Retrieve the token and certificate;
3. Configure the Role Based Access Control in your cluster with ClusterRoleBinding where you will bind the cluster-admin role to the ServiceAccount you just created;
4. Register the cluster in GitLab using the API URL, the token and the certificate. Since GitLab 11.5, GitLab will automatically create a ServiceAccount with the edit role. This ServiceAccount will interact with the cluster during the CIs;
5. GitLab will propose to deploy some services such as [Helm](https://helm.sh/), Tiller, GitLab Runner, Prometheus, NginX Ingress, CertManager, [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub) and [Knative](https://pivotal.io/knative) and add new CI variables: KUBE_URL, KUBE_TOKEN, KUBE_NAMESPACE, KUBE_CA_PEM_FILE;
6. Write your CI, everything is ready!

Important note: GitLab Community Edition only allows the integration of one cluster. You can still manually integrate your cluster by manipulating the CI variables but you will not have access to the monitoring, the logs, the console an the other features provided by the GitLab integration.
