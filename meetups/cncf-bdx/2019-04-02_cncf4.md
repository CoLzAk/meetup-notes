# Cloud Native Computing Foundation Bordeaux #4

## CNCF time

### News
- CNCF Bordeaux is now an official CNCF group ðŸŽ‰;
- Kubernetes 1.14 is now generally available. Among the features: support for Windows nodes, updates in Kubectl and addition of Persistent Local Volumes. Go read the announcement [here](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/25/kubernetes-1-14-release-announcement/) ;
- The French translation initiative for the Kubernetes documentation is still ongoing. If you are interested, visit the [Kubernetes doc](https://kubernetes.io/fr/docs/home/) or fork the [website repository](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/tree/master/content)!

### Introduction

The OVH Managed Kubernetes platform has been released in beta during the OVH Summit, the 18th of October of 2018. The response has been fast; today the solution supports over 2000 active clusters, 10k pods on the administration clusters, 1500 CPUs and 22 Terabytes of RAM! The offer is managed because the Masters, a.k.a. Control plane, and some Node components, a.k.a. Compute, are taken in charge by OVH.

In their architecture, the Masters contain etcd, the OpenStack interface for Persistent Volumes, health checks, a load balancer, a route controller, the scheduler and API Server. This essential last component centralizes the connections between the Control plane and the Compute. Each node contains a kubelet and a kube-proxy, both managed by OVH as well.

In all of this, the critical components are etcd, API Server and kube-proxy. This project being very dependent of Kubernetes and having rewritten most of its core components, it is not recommended to try this at home.

### Kubernetes in Kubernetes?

The presented architecture actually contains itself! The Managed Kubernetes solution is a giant Kubernetes cluster which nodes are also Kubernetes! Only the client-facing nodes and etcd are managed separately from the system. This allows OVH to very quickly deploy new clusters.

Side-effect: internally, the communication is handled by kube-proxy and routed through the OVH Load Balancer. This allows OVH to use their dedicated network to their full potential and to provide a solid and performant backbone for the Managed Kubernetes solution. The interface to access the services is NodePort.

Admin nodes can communicate with API Server with TLS + SNI, meaning that the hostname appears in clear in the request. Client nodes can communicate through a TCP tunnel with API Server, using the kubelet and kube-proxy.
