### Introduction

The OVH Managed Kubernetes platform has been released in beta during the OVH Summit, the 18th of October of 2018. The response has been fast; today the solution supports over 2000 active clusters, 10k pods on the administration clusters, 1500 CPUs and 22 Terabytes of RAM! The offer is managed because the Masters, a.k.a. Control plane, and some Node components, a.k.a. Compute, are taken in charge by OVH.
