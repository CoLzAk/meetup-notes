Good read, if you are interested in DevOps: [https://devops.com/](https://devops.com/). Articles, webinars, and more.

## Introduction
Strong open source believers and contributors and organizers in the spirit, Estelle and François represent an excellent mix of skills that can help companies progress on the engineering front. This meetup will be an experience feedback as much as a presentation of some UX techniques applied to organizations.

First off, what is a DevOps and a UX?  
A DevOps is a bridge between developers and Operations. They understand what developers create and help them carry their code from their computers to the remote environments, held by the system and network administrators. The Operations part also adds automation and the reduction of the different frictions developers might encounter in the process.  
A UX combines product design, technology and strategy. They aim for the removal of any form of user frustration to create the most pleasant product experience. The UX cycle works like a classic Design Sprint: it starts by laying out a plan, a strategy for the current product and objectives. Then, we explore different paths and retain the most relevant ones, for which we generate ideas of all sorts. These ideas are sorted and some of them will actually be prototyped or implemented, then evaluated internally or against end users, which will feed a new exploration phase and so on.

## The Mix

François was a developer before becoming a DevOps. In his former company, DevOps were not really understood and wrongly associated with Operations. DevOps were often late because they never had the opportunity to automate their deployments, which slowed down the entire production. That is when Estelle joined the company. Her first mission as a Product Owner was to help the DevOps team prioritizing and organizing. The problem is more often than not linked to communication between the stakeholders, in our case the DevOps team, the developers and the hierarchy.

### Part One: The Speed Boat

The first objectives were the following:
- Send more workload to developers and Operations;
- Redefine what the DevOps team should and should not handle;
- Enhance the communication.

For that, the UX decided to use the [Speed Boat](http://www.agile-ux.com/2011/10/17/a-speed-boat-or-nothing/) with a handful of members of the developers, DevOps and Operational teams. This Agile exercise is intended for retrospectives, which is kind of the case here, considering this is a lingering issue. We can see the Speed Boat as a simple motor boat with anchors:
- Your destination is your ideal, the situation you would like to reach;
- The motor is the set of elements that are helping you reaching the destination;
- The deployed anchors are the obstacles that slow you down.

Once the Speed Boat is layed down, we can clearly identify what is wrong, remedy most of the anchors and reinforce the motor. This exercise is easy to setup but the format is such that you will not get a lot of feedbacks. Nevertheless, you might retrieve interesting insights out of it.
