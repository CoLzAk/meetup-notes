Some good reads:
- [The pragmatic Programmer](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/020161622X/), by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas
- [The Software Craftsman](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-software-craftsman/9780134052625/), by Sandro Mancuso

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is at the heart of the Software Craftsmanship culture, so much that the names of great programmers co-signed it. The subsequent evolutions of the Agile community, like the SCRUM implementation, casted doubt about the effectiveness of Agile in organizations. The co-signers themselves denounced faulty practices such as Agile Certifications.
