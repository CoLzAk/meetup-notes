## On Software Craftsmanship

Software Craftsmanship is a philosophy set on the the principle of continuous improvement applied to IT. Refer to the [Software Craftsmanship introduction](https://github.com/vcz-fr/meetup-notes/blob/master/meetups/okiwi-bdx/2019-03-19_Software-craftsmanship-back-to-basics.md) for an in-depth explanation of that philosophy.

One of the key concepts of Software Craftsmanship is the community. This concept evolved drastically for developers during the last ten years with a shift from mostly online sharing to Groups such as [Okiwi](https://okiwi.org/), Meetups, Brown Bag Lunches, Coding Dojos and entire conferences like the [BDX I/O](https://www.bdx.io/).

Software development is not just defined by a set of people writing lines of codes. This step is preceded and followed by a list of decisions that will ease future maintenance, if applicable. Developers are constansly reading software thus making decisions that tend to make the code understandable more quickly will prove beneficial to the development teams in the long term. This can avoid situations such as retro-engineering each piece of code or rewriting from scratch. Software quality is a very vast domain that spreads across architecture, code and tests.

## Architecture

Unfortunately, today, few are the tools and metrics that could make Software architecture durably better. Only experience and exchange can help and practices such as Pair design, Design review (much like code review but for architecture), reading and attending presentations, etc.
